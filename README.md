Instructions on how to install Droidian, Manjaro ARM and UBPorts on Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL (Bonito & Sargo)

## Android 9

### Upgrading to Bookworm
As of now there are no images for Bookworm (coming soon). Is recommended to upgrade from Bullseye.

1. Ensure your system is up-to-date (you can use the Software app)
2. Install the ```droidian-upgrade-bookworm``` package:

```sudo apt install droidian-upgrade-bookworm```

3. Fetch the new repositories:

```sudo apt update```
<br>```sudo apt upgrade```

4. Finally, do a standard dist-upgrade (note: it would be best doing this on-device):

```sudo apt update```
<br>```sudo apt dist-upgrade```

5. Clean up and reboot

```sudo apt clean```
<br>```sudo reboot -f```

6. Once the system reboots, open the Software app, go to the Updates tab -> Search for updates again -> Install the remaining updates

### Known Issues
1. Camera & Flashlight do not work
2. Battery life is short (better on Pixel 3a XL)
3. Waydroid installs but is very slow.
4. Finger reader does not work (on all Droidian devices)
5. Some KDE flatpak apps won't launch

### Add Staging Repo (Optional)

Change release to <b>bullseye</b> or <b>bookworm</b> depending on your release version. Add:

```deb http://staging.repo.droidian.org/ release main```

to ```/etc/apt/source.list```

## Manjaro ARM
Manjaro ARM is a bit slower than Droidian and it has the same known issues.

### Install
1. Download ```Manjaro-ARM-phosh-halium-9.zip``` or ```Manjaro-ARM-nemomobile-halium-9.zip``` from https://github.com/manjaro-libhybris/image-ci/releases
2. Download the Sargo files for Manjaro ARM from https://github.com/giovannicaligaris/linux-pixel-3a/releases/tag/v1
3. Add your ```twrp.img``` inside the downloaded folder
4. Run ```./flash-all.sh```
5. Head to ```Advanced``` and sideload Manjaro-ARM-*.zip
6. ```adb sideload Manjaro-ARM-**-halium-9-**.zip```
7. Sideload might get stuck at 47%, just wait patiently
8. Reboot the phone after sideloading
9. Password: ```123456```

### Adjust Resolution
Make sure your phone is connected to a USB cable.

```ssh manjaro@10.15.19.82```
<br>```sudo nano /usr/share/phosh/phoc.ini```

Add 

```[output:HWCOMPOSER-1]```
<br>```scale = 3```

Save, exit and reboot

```sudo reboot -f```

### Updating
For some reason Manjaro does not seem to remember repo keys and it won't allow to update or install packages. Install the following:

```sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate```
<br>```sudo pacman -S gnupg archlinuxarm-keyring yay libpamac-flatpak-plugin iio-sensor-proxy iio-utils libhandy```

If keeps asking for GNUPG keys, just repopulate and try to install the packages that you need

```sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate```
